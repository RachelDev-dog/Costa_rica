# COSTA RICA VACATION INFORMATIONAL WEB PAGE

Me and my girlfriend took a trip to Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica at the end of August 2025 and had an amazing time. 

I took the opportunity to practice my web development skills and show off all our awesome pictures in a fun web page.

It is a work in progress, as I'm waiting for my lovely girlfriend to wright out descriptions of our adventures, while i develop layout and functionality.
